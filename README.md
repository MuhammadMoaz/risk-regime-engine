# **Risk Regime Engine**

## The Idea
This yet to be named project is a risk regime engine which classifies the market environment and shwos the likelihood of price moving up, down, or sideways. The intial plan is to focus on the cryptocurrency market, specificaly BTC and ETH.

## Development Roadmap
### Phase 0 - Planning Phase (Week 0-1)
In this phase I want to set boundaries, clearly outline the rules, and define the project purpose. The deliverables of this phase will include:
- A GitHub Repo,
- A README file, and
- A clearly defined direction

### Phase 1 - Framing and Scope
This phase will consist of deciding the following:
- Markets: BTC + ETH
- Update Frequency: Daily
- Output:
    - Risk Regime ()
    - Probabilities (up/flat/down)
- Target Audience:
    - Not day traders
    - All experience levels
- Deliverables
    - What the project does
    - What problem it solves
    - What is explicitly does not do

### Phase 2 - MVP/Core Functionality
The goal of this phase is to build a simple, bare-bones project that:
1. Fetches historical price data
2. Looks at recent behaviour
3. Identifies the current market environment
4. Looks atr similar historical environments
5. Outputs probabilitiues for what typically happens as JSON
There will be no focus on the UI, and presentation in this phase. It is purely focused on implementing the core funcationality/logic of the project.

### Phase 3 - MMP/Refinement
In this phase I'll convert the MVP developed in phase 2 into something more human readable and understandable. This will be done by taking the output (JSON) and displaying it on a simple web page. It will show today's regime, the probabilities, and include one short explanatory sentence.

### Phase 4 - Initial Marketing & User Feedback
Phase 4 will consist of initial marketing and light sharing. I'll start by sharing it with friends, on social media, and online forums in hopes of gauging whether there is a market for such a tool. If the user feedback is positive, I'll move on to light marketing in the form of branded social media content, and if everything looks good, paid advertising. I'll collect user feedback through a landing page linked in the advertisements and social media content.

### Phase 5 - Decision: Archive or Scale?
Phase 5 is the most important phase as it will be where I decide whether I want to keep improving and scaling this project with the hopes of becoming profitable or archiving it and instead using it as experience and a learning opportunity.
